# Banking API

Hey guys! Here's my implementation of the Banking API.

# About configuration files

You will need to setup a `development.js` file in the `config/` directory in which you'll declare your *fixer* access key.

The file should look like the following:

```js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  fixer: {
    accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
  },
}
```
